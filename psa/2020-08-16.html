<p>A bunch more minor tweaks!</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Tutorial is now excluded from the school end time because it's effectively
    optional.
  </li>
  <li>
    Period 8 is now disabled by default to reduce confusion. If you have a
    period 8, turn it back on in Options.
  </li>
  <li>PSAs won't be marked as read when UGWA auto-updates.</li>
  <li>
    The alternate schedules stored offline has been reset, so last year's
    alternate schedules don't prop up this year and show school on Saturday.
  </li>
  <li>
    The normal schedule will show as a placeholder while alternate schedules
    load.
  </li>
  <li>
    Notifications at the start of a period will open the period's associated
    link when clicked.
  </li>
  <li>Empty assignments are editable now.</li>
  <li>
    Fixed colours not showing properly in the assignment editor's period
    dropdown.
  </li>
  <li>There's now a hint on how to stop viewing a barcode just in case.</li>
</ul>
