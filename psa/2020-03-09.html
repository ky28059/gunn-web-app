<p>UGWA now is available in French thanks to <a href="https://github.com/ky28059">ky28059</a>. In the options tab, select "Fran√ßais" under "Languages."</p>
<p>UGWA also now displays the alternate schedule properly for March 11th. Apparently the school put the event in a different Google Calendar that UGWA doesn't fetch alternate schedules from, so UGWA thought the day was a normal day.</p>
