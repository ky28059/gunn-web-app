  Did your power go out today? Fortunately, UGWA's didn't! Here are some extra
  features to start off the school year.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    There's now an option to show notifications a given time before a class
    starts or ends. I don't think iOS Safari supports notifications, though.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can now swipe between days; there's an option to turn this off if needed
    (on by default).
  </li>
  <li>You can click on a day in the week overview to jump to it.</li>
  <li>
    The Gunn Together period on Wednesday now has a badge to avoid confusion
    over why the first week has two adjacent period 5's.
  </li>
</ul>
